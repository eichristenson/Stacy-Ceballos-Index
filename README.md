# Stacy-Ceballos-Index
Code to calculate the Stacy-Ceballos index and other virus infection metrics, as well as to make graphs to visualize the data.
Using the equations from "Quantifying relative virulence", https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001515

Use the file "testing.xlsx" to format your data for R. 

Use the file "ISC-and-Growth-Curve-Graphs-5-19-2023-Update" to calculate the following metrics and make graphs
- Area under the curve (AUC) for control bacteria and bacteria plus phage
- Percent growth inibition based on AUC values (PIAUC)
- Nasymptote growth peak for control bacteria and bacteria plus phage 
- Percent growth inibition based on Nasymptote values (PIMAX)
- Stacy-Ceballos index (Isc)
- Relative virulence (VR)
